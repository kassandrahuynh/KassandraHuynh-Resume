        <p class="lead mb-4">Greetings,<br><br>

        I am born and raised in the Bay Area and now based in Orange County. I am a 1st Generation college student in my immediate family. My background is of Vietnamese descent, and I am strongly rooted in the community back home and Southern California (Orange County). My grandparents and parents are refugees from the Vietnam War and came to the United States in the late 70s. I made the big move from Northern California to Southern California for college.<br><br>
        
        Undergraduate at the University of California Riverside in the Pre-Business program. Currently attending my 2nd year at the university. Planning to declare Business-Finance as my concentration when I am finished with my program. Furthermore, my ultimate goal is to get a Bachelors of Science in my preferred concentration. Involved and affiliated with the Vietnamese Student Association on campus.<br><br>
        
        I maintained 2 jobs during my senior year of high school where I worked as a barista at both locations. I became a shift lead for one of the locations where my responsibilities were to train new/potential employees whilst supervising the activities of the store. I managed the register and acted as a barista during my shifts, and I was also in charge of making food items on the menu as well. Another responsibility was to check stock every so often during a shift and to restock if necessary. In other words, I would have to step out of the store in order to restock the items. I gained a new perspective and skills on management and multitasking after this experience. I acquired a new mindset and set of skills that progressed my work ethic. During the recent summer, I worked as a hostess at a fast-paced restaurant. The job required me to always be on my toes and to develop a strong stream of communication with everyone in the workplace. It was a team effort indeed. The restaurant would not suffice without the whole team working together. In my time there, I honed my communication skills and being able to think on my feet. I obtained more knowledge and experience than I expected and imagined. Given my experiences, I believe that I am able to be more than competent in my next endeavor. I hope to work with new and different projects/companies that can allow me to grow as a person and to meet people who share a similar passion for learning and bettering themselves for their careers and futures.<br><br>
        
        Future goals and plans I have in mind are to gain experience during and after my Undergraduate studies. I do plan to return to college and pursue a Masters degree in Business-Finance as well. By using the experience I have gained, applying the skills and knowledge into my Masters degree will be most beneficial to my future and career.<br><br>
